**PythonREST** is the ultimate full API generator for Python language. Based on the best performing frameworks and software development best practices, PythonREST can create an entire **CRUD API** in minutes or seconds based on your relational database on a single CLI command. This allows you to create your APIs from scratch and update your current API previously created with our tool to always match your latest database definitions.

THIS WILL SAVE YOU MONTHS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME, GUARANTEED!

Your new generated API will have full CRUD compatibility with your mapped database and full swagger documentation and specs available. With your new API in hand, you will be able to containerize or serverless deploy it to any local, private and public cloud providers of your choice and use it at will! If you're interested in taking your API to the next level and don't know how, please inquiry us on the email below for consultancies.

This project is under active enhancement and we have several open GitHub issues so we can improve it even further, if you're an Open Source enthusiast and wish to contribute, we'd be more than happy to have you on our team!
