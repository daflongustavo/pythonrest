How Is PythonREST good for Developers?
--------------------------------------

PythonREST allows you to have an entire CRUD API ready in minutes or seconds to fully manipulate your relational database. This will allow you to only need to write code specifically for functions that require third party integration or have super complex business rules. These are the project possibilities our project can provide you:

* Create an API with PythonREST, add your own custom routes and update your CRUD routes at will keeping the best of both worlds.
* Install PythonREST on your pipeline, containerize or serverless your new application and have entire APIs with no need for repositories for them.
* Have your PythonREST API manage your CRUD operations and any other applications in any language manage the rest. This is a nice option if you're not a Python developer and wish the best from both worlds.
